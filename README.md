# ftp_exploit

This project demonstrates a basic batch script to exploit the VSFTPD vulnerability. The script prompts the user for the target IP address and then attempts to trigger the backdoor and gain access.

**Warning:** This is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use is illegal.

## Files

- `scripts/ftp_script.txt`: FTP commands with placeholder for the IP address.
